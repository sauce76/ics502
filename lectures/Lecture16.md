## Kernel Functions 

- $K(x_i,x_j) = \phi(x_i)^T \cdot \phi(x_j)$ is our desired mapping function to have a dot product of this form, $Input \ Space \rarr \ Feature \ Space$.
- We are only interested to calculate the **_result_** of the dot product in the Feature Space



## Side Notes:

- Cartesian product
    : $ A = \{1,2 \}\\ B=\{2,3,4\} \\ A\cdot B = \left\{ (1,2), (1,3), (1,4),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4) \right\}$
